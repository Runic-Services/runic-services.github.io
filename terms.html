</strong><br>These Terms of Service may be edited at any time with or without prior notice. The modified version of the Terms of Service does not apply to any pending orders and only newly created ones. We will try our best to remove any publicly available versions of the old terms of service however this may not be possible. If your order falls on the date our terms change, you will be informed which copy of the terms your project applies to.
<br>
<br>You are not permitted to redistribute, resell, or leak the product in any form. Usage including but not limited to uploading the custom or pre-made product on any forum or distributing to your associates is prohibited. We do, however allow sharing the product between the staff team of your organisation as an exception. However, if your staff member decides to leak or redistribute a product, you will be held accountable.
<br>
<br>Any of our products sold on marketplaces are sold 'as-is' and will not be modified after purchase.
<br>
<br><strong>Communication
</strong><br>Do not deal with team members in private chats including Discord Servers other than Runic Services. If a call is necessary the team member is obliged to record it, otherwise that call is not allowed. Orphic Builds is not responsible if you are scammed outside of the official discord server. Staff will be punished accordingly.
<br>
<br><strong>Payments
</strong><br>All payments must be made via PayPal using Goods &amp; Services. You will cover all fees.
<br>
<br>All orders under $10 are required to be paid in full before our team starts your order. All orders above $10 must be paid 50% upfront, and 50% after completion or 100% upfront if you wish.
<br>
<br>All payments made on our online store must be paid upfront.
<br>
<br>A minimum order fee of $5 is applied to every order.
<br>
<br><strong>Refunds
</strong><br>Refunds on any products are typically not given due to the nature of our goods. A refund of up to 25% is given for a missed deadline, 25% if you are unsatisfied with the final product, or 50% if the delivered product is clearly below our high standards. Exact refund percentages are determined by at least 1 member from the Leadership Team.
<br>
<br>You may be charged extra for your order if you change your idea during the order (up to 50% on top of the original price if the product is under 50% done, or whatever the team member feels is appropriate if the product is above 50% done), a bug fix 7 days after order completion (up to 25% on top of the original price), or change in a product after completion (whatever the team member feels is appropriate). All changes must be approved by at least 1 member of the Leadership Team.
<br>
<br>Chargebacks, disputes, or attempting to get your money back without going through the proper process (fraudulent) is not permitted and will be considered as scamming. Chargebacks through for our online store through PayPal will result in a permanent ban from our Discord server and services.
<br>
<br><strong>Promotions
</strong><br>Please note that a minimum order value of $5 applies to any order. Any voucher code cannot override the minimum order value unless explicitly stated.
<br>
<br><strong>Agreement
</strong><br>By purchasing any service from Runic Services you agree to all Terms and Conditions of Service listed above.
<br>
<br>By not following these Terms and Conditions, you will be permanently banned from our Discord Server and a scam report will be filed on MC-Market! (Other consequences may be pursued by the Leadership Team)
<br>
<br>We reserve to right to sell any custom products on our online store and other marketplace(s) if an Leadership Member deems it necessary. This could be due to lack of response in a ticket, a chargeback, or failure to confirm your order, etc.
